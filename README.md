    This is an app that allows the user to organize the classes that they are taking and the homework for each class.
    This allows the user to see everything they have to do in one easy to use screen / app, so that they don't end up forgetting about a class.
    It's simple to learn and easy to use, resulting in a quick, fast, and stress-free user experience.
